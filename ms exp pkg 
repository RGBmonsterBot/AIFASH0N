**Here’s a brief summary of the key steps**:

1. **Containerization**: 
   - Create Docker containers for your services, such as the example for Stanley.3.2.
   - Example Dockerfile:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM node:16
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . .
     RUN npm install
     CMD ["node", "stanley.js"]
     ```

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions for your repository at `myWeb3DoDnettwerk@github.com`.

3. **Monitoring and Notifications**:
   - Integrate Telegram notifications using the provided bot link to keep track of your deployments.

### Troubleshooting Termux Errors
It seems like you're facing issues with resolving the hostname for `termux.net` during package installation. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Network Connection**:
   - Ensure your internet connection is stable.
   - Try accessing other websites to verify connectivity.

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Sometimes DNS issues can cause hostname resolution problems. You can try using a different DNS server, such as Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare's DNS (1.1.1.1).

3. **Update Package List**:
   - Run `apt-get update` to refresh the package list.
   - If the issue persists, try using `apt-get update --fix-missing` to handle missing packages.

4. **Mirror Change**:
   - If `termux.net` is facing downtime or issues, consider changing the repository mirror in your Termux configuration to an alternative.
