### Troubleshooting Termux Errors
It seems like you're facing issues with resolving the hostname for `termux.net` during package installation. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Network Connection**:
   - Ensure your internet connection is stable.
   - Try accessing other websites to verify connectivity.

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Sometimes DNS issues can cause hostname resolution problems. You can try using a different DNS server, such as Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare's DNS (1.1.1.1).

3. **Update Package List**:
   - Run `apt-get update` to refresh the package list.
   - If the issue persists, try using `apt-get update --fix-missing` to handle missing packages.

4. **Mirror Change**:
   - If `termux.net` is facing downtime or issues, consider changing the repository mirror in your Termux configuration to an alternative.
